# Auto-Commit
This is a simple program that modifies himself and commits to this repo automatically.
The main purpose of this repo is to check whether this is acceptable by GitHub or if they may detect this kind of things.

# Conclusions
After having executed this program for an hour it obtained more than 5 thousand commits. GitHub didn't close the repo neither notified me even though the commits where made very fast. So the conclusion may be that if you commit slow enough just not to make a DDOS attack to the GitHub servers your auto-commit repo will be ok.


**The repo was erased of all commits just to have a fair account**
